Fork of [frap129/OpenQ1](https://github.com/frap129/OpenQ1) with cartographer support and some other tweaks. I probalby wouldn't recommend copying this config wholesale, but it might be a useful reference. 

I'm using [this cartographer mount](https://www.printables.com/model/1205523-qidi-q1-pro-cartographer-mount) by gullygosner on printables.
